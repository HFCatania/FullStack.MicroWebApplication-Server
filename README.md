Good morning teams. Here's a quick tip for those of you who are interested in landing a job when you gradudate.
Take 10 mins and update the read me files in your group projects as well as your passion projects in your github. Make it easy for a potential employer to clone your repo and run it locally on their machines so they can see all of the good work you've done.
At the very least you should have:
* 1) what the project mission is
* 2) how to build and run the project (example npm install + ng serve or mvn clean package + mvn spring-boot:run --Darg1=blah)
